    <string name="fragment_info_h1">How to calculate the daily caloric value of a cat\'s diet</string>
    <string name="fragment_info_2">Cats are curious and agile predators. They require a lot of energy for their vital activity. Therefore, it is important for the owner to calculate the caloric content of the food so that the pet has enough calories for its vital activity, and there is no excess calories left, which will be deposited in the sides and belly of the pet.</string>
    <string name="fragment_info_3">Factors affecting caloric requirements:\n
1. The pet\'s health condition, cats suffering from diseases of the genitourinary system or gastrointestinal tract, eat less or refuse to eat at all;\n
2. Change of diet: transfer to another food should be done gradually, mixing a small amount of it into the old food;\n
3. Age: kittens, lactating and pregnant cats need twice as many calories, and older cats need fewer calories;\n
4. Animal mobility: a walking cat eats more than an inactive house cat;\n
5. Sex and breed of cat (there are types of cats prone to obesity).</string>
    <string name="fragment_info_4_formulaintro">For cats and dogs weighing more than 2 kg, the basal and metabolic energy values are determined using the following formulas:</string>
    <string name="fragment_info_4_formulabaz">Base energy (kcal/day) = 30 × body mass (m) + 70</string>
    <string name="fragment_info_4_formulamet">Metabolic energy (kcal/day) = K × (30 x body weight + 70)</string>
    <string name="fragment_info_4_koef">K - coefficient according to the table below.</string>
    <string name="fragment_info_5">Answering the question "Why should you torture your cat with diet", we remind you that obesity, to which uncontrolled eating of cat food by animals can lead, will not add to your health. So it\'s up to you!</string>
