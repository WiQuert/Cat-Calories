# About this app

## Description

This app allows you to calculate your cat's daily calorie allowance.

**Why do I need it?**

Cats are curious and agile predators. They require a lot of energy for their vital activity. Therefore, it is important for the owner to calculate the caloric content of the food so that the pet has enough calories for its vital activity, and there is no excess calories left, which will be deposited in the sides and belly of the pet.

**Factors affecting caloric requirements:**

1. The pet's health condition, cats suffering from diseases of the genitourinary system or gastrointestinal tract, eat less or refuse to eat at all;
2. Change of diet: transfer to another food should be done gradually, mixing a small amount of it into the old food;
3. Age: kittens, lactating and pregnant cats need twice as many calories, and older cats need fewer calories;
4. Animal mobility: a walking cat eats more than an inactive house cat;
5. Sex and breed of cat (there are types of cats prone to obesity).
